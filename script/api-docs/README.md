# API Documentation Generator

These scripts generate the "raw API" specs and reference documentation
for [www.libgit2.org](https://libgit2.org/docs/reference).

The "raw API" specs consists of JSON documents, on per
released version or branch, that describes the APIs. This is
suitable for creating documentation from, or may be useful for
language bindings as well.

The reference documentation is documentation fragments for each
API in each version, ready to be included in the libgit2 documentation
website.
