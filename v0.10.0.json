object\n\n This method instructs the library to close an existing\n object; note that git_objects are owned and cached by the repository\n so the object may or may not be freed after this library call,\n depending on how agressive is the caching mechanism used\n by the repository.\n\n IMPORTANT:\n It is *not* necessary to call this method when you stop using\n an object, since all object memory is automatically reclaimed\n by the repository when it is freed.\n\n Forgetting to call `git_object_close` does not cause memory\n leaks, but it's is recommended to close as soon as possible\n the biggest objects (e.g. blobs) to prevent wasting memory\n space.\n\n @param object the object to close\n\n","args":[{"type":"git_object *","comment":"the object to
